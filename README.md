# Stock-Sentiment-Analysis
Project Description
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to analyze public sentiment from news articles and social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Reddit) and correlate it with stock market performance. By combining sentiment analysis with historical stock price data, the project aims to predict stock price movements and provide actionable insights through a user-friendly dashboard.

The system features data collection from APIs, sentiment analysis using TensorFlow, machine learning-based price movement predictions, and backtesting of trading strategies. It serves as a powerful tool for traders, analysts, and researchers interested in leveraging sentiment-driven insights for stock market forecasting.
